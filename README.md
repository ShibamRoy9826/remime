# Remime

An easy and efficient way to manage your time using the terminal! 
written with ❤️  in Python and [textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/) :)

> [!NOTE]
> This application is a little buggy right now, but still usable, I am working with my best on it! Any contribution will be appreciated!
> Please report the bugs if you see them!

## Features 😎

- A Pomodoro mode, with an automatic breaks option (Customizable)
- It can take backups of your timer, so incase you exit by mistake, the next time you open it, you will almost be on the same place!
- Highly customizable overall
- Multiple themes that [textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/) provides 
- Modes include: Stopwatch, Clock, 24-hour Clock, Timer, and Pomodoro
- Keybindings for almost everything! not customizable at the moment but planning to work on that on the next update!

## Dependencies

The dependencies include: 

- [textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/)

- [toml](https://pypi.org/project/toml/)

- [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) (For the audio)

Although the dependencies will be automatically installed while installing the application, if you still want to install these dependencies manually, you can checkout the `requirements.txt` file. and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
If you want to use something other than feh or swww, you can do that by enabling `other` in the configuration file, and setting the cmd parameter

If you're on Arch Linux, like me, then you can install it from the AUR:
```bash
paru -S remime
```

There's also a development version to check out the latest changes:
```bash
paru -S remime-git
```
Make sure to replace `paru` with whatever AUR helper you use.

For other distros try (installs locally to the user):
```bash
python setup.py install --user
```
if you want to install it systemwide, you can try:
```bash
sudo python setup.py install
```

If your distro allows python package installation directly using pip,
You can install EasyFeh by cloning this repository locally.
Here's the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShibamRoy9826/remime.git
cd remime
pip install .
```
That's it! read the usage of the commands and enjoy!

## To-Do 🛠️
- An "--at" mode to set an alarm which would ring at a specific time
- Configurable buttons
- Custom keybindings
- Rich Markdown integration, so that command line output looks more highlighted and beautiful
- Nice quotes on top of clock border
- Work on a lightweight alternative for the audio

## Known bugs 🐞
- Hovering on Pause/Start button occasionally causes weird colors to show up
- Doesn't backup breaks
